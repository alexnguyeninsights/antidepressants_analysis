# âš¡ Machine Learning for Antidepressant Adverse Event Classification

## 1. Project Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to classify adverse events (AEs) associated with antidepressants using the FDAâ€™s FAERS database (2018â€“2023). It evaluates Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Clinical-BERT models to categorize AEs into standard MedDRA System Organ Classes, and investigates emerging risks via topic modelling and disproportionality analysis.

The project demonstrates end-to-end skills in clinical data cleaning, natural language processing (NLP), machine learning model development, and post-COVID impact analysis.

## 2. Dataset
* Source: FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)
* Description: Reports of patient demographics, medications, adverse events, and outcomes.
* Period Covered: January 2018 â€“ December 2023
* Records: ~1.9M raw case reports reduced to 118,577 cleaned records

---

## 3. Tools and Libraries
* Python 3: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
* Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, SVC, TF-IDF), TensorFlow/Keras (Clinical-BERT)
* NLP: Gensim (LDA Topic Modelling), WordCloud, pyLDAvis
* Statistical Analysis: PMDARIMA, Disproportionality Analysis (PRR, ROR)

---

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Data Preprocessing
* Downloaded FAERS quarterly datasets from 2018â€“2023.
* Merged DEMO, DRUG, INDI, REAC, OUTC, and RPSR tables based on primary IDs.
* Focused on suspected antidepressant drugs and patients aged 12+.
* Mapped adverse event (AE) symptoms to MedDRA System Organ Class categories.

### 4.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Visualized distributions of AE categories, antidepressant types, age, and gender groups.
* Decomposed trends over time to observe pre-, during-, and post-COVID patterns.

### 4.3 Feature Engineering
* Built TF-IDF vectors from AE textual data.
* Created COVID-period labels (pre, during, post) for additional context.
* Applied PCA (optional) for feature reduction if required for modelling efficiency.

### 4.4 Modelling
* Logistic Regression and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) models with TF-IDF features.
* Clinical-BERT fine-tuned on AE descriptions for advanced classification.
* LDA Topic Modelling to extract hidden patterns and emerging AE risks.

### 4.5 Model Evaluation
* Metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, Area Under the Curve (AUC).
* Results:

| Model                 | Accuracy | F1-score | AUC         |
|------------------------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Logistic Regression    | Moderate | Moderate | Good        |
| Support Vector Machine | High     | High     | Very Good   |
| Clinical-BERT          | Very High (~100%) | Very High | Excellent (~1.0) |

=> Clinical-BERT achieved the best performance but required significant computing resources.

### 4.6 Key Takeaways
* Clinical-BERT significantly improved AE classification but is resource-intensive.
* Logistic Regression and SVC are strong, lightweight alternatives for AE categorization.
* SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) exhibited higher AE rates during COVID.
* Topic Modelling revealed emerging concerns like "haemorrhage" and "serotonin syndrome".

---

### 4.7 Future Improvements
* Extend analysis to other mental health indications and drug classes.
* Deploy resource-optimized BERT variants (e.g., DistilBERT) for faster classification.
* Expand disproportionality analysis across a broader medication set.
* Integrate multi-label classification to handle complex AE symptoms across categories.

### 4.8 How to Run
* Clone this repository.
* Install required libraries: pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn pmdarima gensim tensorflow transformers wordcloud pyldavis
* Run the notebooks sequentially to: Preprocess and clean FAERS data, Train models (Logistic Regression, SVC, and Clinical-BERT), Perform Topic Modelling and Disproportionality Analysis, Visualise insights
